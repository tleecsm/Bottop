## The Most Personality You'll Ever Find in a Discord Bot

### Bottop
Bottop is a pet project I've had for several years.   
Bottop is a user interactable Discord bot that provides all manner of memes to any Discord server.
It started with an interest to learn Javascript via an interesting and useful application.
  
However, when I started classes at Colorado School of Mines, I quickly became overwhelmed with work and was forced to stop development of Bottop.  I intended to halt development for a short time while I adjusted to new classes and work at a new school, but I underestimated the time investment CSM would prove to be.  
  
I'm writing this README from a room on campus during the first week of Summer Break.  I am currently enrolled in the Computer Science Field Session and working for Newmont Exploration.  Thankfully however, the session is very managable work, and I am finding myself with extended periods of free time.  As such, I've decided to reboot and revitalize my favorite project.  

### Bottop Reloaded
Bottop is back, and his name is dumber than ever.  
Bottop Reloaded is Bottop in name only.  I've decided to spend some of my free time this summer rebuilding Bottop from the ground up.  My old javascript code is a disaster and was written before the majority of my Software Engineering courses.  As expected, the code was hard to follow and impossible to maintain.  For this reason, the original Bottop became nonfunctioning soon after I ceased maintainence.  BtR will serve as my penance for this.
